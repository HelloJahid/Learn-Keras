# `Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs)`

Recurrent neural networks (RNN), a class of neural networks that exploit the sequential nature of their input. It stores the state of a previous output and combines with the current input thereby preserving some relationship of the current input with the previous input. Recurrent neural networks (RNN), a class of neural networks that exploit the sequential nature of their input. Such inputs could be text, speech, time series, and anything else where the occurrence of an element in the sequence is dependent on the elements that appeared before it. For example, the next word in the sentence the dog... is more likely to be barks than car, therefore, given such a sequence, an RNN is more likely to predict barks than car.

An RNN can be thought of as a graph of RNN cells, where each cell performs the same operation on every element in the sequence. RNNs are very flexible and have been used to solve problems such as speech recognition, language modeling, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and image captioning, to name a few. RNNs can be adapted to different types of problems by rearranging the way the cells are arranged in the graph. We will see some examples of these configurations and how they are used to solve specific problems
