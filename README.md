# `Learn-Keras`

This repository contains material about pytorch from scratch to advanced. It consists of notebooks as well as python file for various deep learning topics. In most cases, the notebooks lead you through implementing models such as Linear Regression, Fully connected neural networks, Convolutional neural networks(CNN), recurrent neural networks(RNN), and GANs. There are other topics covered such as weight initialization and batch normalization.



# `Keras`
Keras is an open-source high-level Neural Network library, which is written in Python is capable enough to run on Theano, TensorFlow, or CNTK. It was developed by one of the Google engineers, Francois Chollet. It is made user-friendly, extensible, and modular for facilitating faster experimentation with deep neural networks. It not only supports Convolutional Networks and Recurrent Networks individually but also their combination.
